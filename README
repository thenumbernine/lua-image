LuaJIT image library
edit image.lua to choose what backend
options are SDL_image, pure LuaJIT, and the Lua bindings for my own image library

pure LuaJIT-version uses the following other projects:
http://luajit.org/
https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-ext
https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-ffi-bindings
https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-LinearSolvers (optional)
...and the PNG, JPEG, and TIFF headers ported to LuaJIT courtesy of https://github.com/malkia/ufo subject to some heavy modifications which I should eventually post ... though they end up needing changing depending on your libraries
